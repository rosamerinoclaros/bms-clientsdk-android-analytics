## Release Notes:

### 1.2.+
- Added location for log recording

To properly enable the location service some configuratios are required in the AndroidManifest.xml.

Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for your Android project. You can find this file in **app > manifests**. Add internet access and location access permission under the `<manifest>` element:

	```
	 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
	 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
	 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
	```
   If you're using sdk version greater than >= 1.2  then you need to put this below part inside the `application` of the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
 
 	```
	 <activity
            android:name="com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.ui.UIActivity"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:launchMode="singleTask">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
	
	```
